# Phone-Directory
Our project “PHONE DIRECTORY” has all the basic functions in which a contact can be ADDED, SEARCHED, UPDATED, DELETED, VIEW PHONE DIRECTORY or QUIT.  We’ve used SHELL SCRIPTING to make our project.
We’ve used SHELL SCRIPTING to make our project. SHELL SCRIPTING is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. It combines a sequence of commands that would otherwise have to be typed into the keyboard one at a time, into a single script. The PHONE DIRECTORY helps in to maintain the contacts in one place with such functionalities.
